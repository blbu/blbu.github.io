    <h2>What&apos;s Azure?</h2>
</header>
<section>
    <p>Disclaimer: I know very little about Azure. This is probably misinformation.</p>
    <p>Azure is "the cloud" from Microsoft. That means we can get {{ VM }}s and all sorts of
        other good stuff. Remember, the cloud is just someone else&apos;s computer&mdash;but if you&apos;re happy to have
        them patch it for you and so on, great! Utilziing technology like Azure let&apos;s you defer up-front capital investment
        into your servers, and "scale-out" more rapidly&mdash;by leveraging <em>their</em> server capacity.</p>
        <p>A basic use case ({{ IaaS }}): you pay for a virtual machine running one of thousands of pre-built images, and you do whatever you want with it. This is easy to get into, because it&apos;s barely more complicated than "VirtualBox on steroids". One model might be fail-over/redundancy for on-premise servers. Another could be "lift and shift"/"P2V"&mdash;virtualizing "box under desk" servers but not utilizing much more than that.</p>
        <p>Another use case ({{ PaaS }}): you buy into the "platform" offerings, such as high-performance, distributed queueing, micro-functions which run on-demand and so on. This is harder to get into, because you have to do things "the cloud way". Models might be a cloud-only startup company.</p>
