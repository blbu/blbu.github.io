        <p><a href="http://www.codecampchristchurch.com/">Code Camp Christchurch</a> was held at Ara Institute of Canterbury.</p>
        <p>I was able to attend this free conference last weekend (13th May 2017). There were some great speakers&mdash;of course, it&apos;s impossible to get to all of the talks.</p>
        <p>A huge thank-you to the organizers, sponsors, and the speakers and people I was able to meet and talk to.</p>
        <p>If I&apos;ve mis-quoted you below, please get in touch and I&apos;ll sort it out ASAP.</p>
        <h4>Azure Infrastructure 101</h4>
        <p><em>Regan Murphy</em></p>
        <p>As I hadn&apos;t had coffee by this stage, I would sum up Regan&apos;s session as a brief introduction to some of the
            {{ IaaS }} and {{ PaaS }} offerings on the Azure stack.</p>
        <p>No idea what Azure is? <a href="whatsazure.html">Read my (tired) thoughts on Azure</a>.</p>
        <p>Like most providers, I find pay-as-you-go is a big draw-card. There are some great solutions for networking, with off-the-internet solutions to integrate with existing on-premise machines. Regan provided a great introduction to this and answered every question thrown his way, he really piqued my interest in Azure. I do wish we&apos;d somehow had more time for this session, as I know Regan would have continued to demonstrate the power of Azure&mdash;and importantly, how to leverage it quickly and flexibly.</p>
        <h4>Things Senior Developers Know</h4>
        <p><em>Bevan Arps</em></p>
        <p>Another great talk, Bevan ran through a "laundry list" of advice gleaned from interviews with senior developers.</p>
        <p>A few para-phrased/pirated tips&mdash;try to find a deeper meaning behind each one:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>"Writing code is the last thing we do"</li>
            <li>(When analyzing requirements) "Security of investment"</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Bevan&apos;s slides were actually enjoyable to read, and he was kind enough to let me fire a few questions his way after the talk. I&apos;d have kept him longer, but unfortunately he is not based in Christchurch&mdash;I may have to travel north sometime.</p>
        <h4>Power BI for Developers</h4>
        <p><em>Peter George</em></p>
        <p>I almost felt overwhelmed in this session, as Peter was quickly engaged in some fascinating technical discussion with some of the audience about data and terms like "dimensional schema" quickly came up. However, unlike Vim vs. Emacs arguments, Peter used the audience&apos;s energy to effectively explore various kinds of "use cases" for Power BI from a service-provider perspective.</p>
        <p>Peter suggested there are three kinds of Power BI "users" (please forgive me, I&apos;m about to use the wrong names entirely):
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Casual User: Pre-defined data, pre-defined reports</li>
            <li>Explorer: Pre-defined data, customizable reports</li>
            <li>Power User: customizable data, customizable reports</li>
        </ul>
        <p>From a provider&apos;s point of view, "Explorers" are a great fit for Power BI, as we can set up a powerful data model and let the user discover new views of existing relationships. For example, a monthly report could give a good view, but become more powerful by also acting as a weekly view by drilling-down, or become more useful by grouping on region.</p>
        <h4>Requirements gathering and other soft skills</h4>
        <p><em>Dorje McKinnon</em></p>
        <p>Be careful if you go to one of these sessions, you&apos;ll learn more than you bargained for. Besides arriving about thirty seconds late (due to coffee), Dorje&apos;s session was hands-on and chock-ful of those "duh, why didn&apos;t I think of this earlier" nuggets.</p>
        <p>As a junior developer, I am still coming to terms with asking questions about work asked of me, and Dorje has good advice (almost a framework) for finding out what the user really wants.</p>
        <p>The audience was full of great developers and local teachers, too.</p>
        <p>Of course, I haven&apos;t got my notes as I&apos;m typing, but "Questions" and "Acceptance" were two of the three main themes discussed.
