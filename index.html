        <h2>This content may move soon</h2>
		<p>Github has made some odd operational choices in recent years.</p>
		<p>I am slowly migrating to other services.</p>
		<p>This ecosystem is still okay for social coding.</p>
        <h2>The five W's</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Journeyman programmer</li>
            <li>New Zealand</li>
            <li>"Software Developer"</li>
            <li>Why? Taking a chisel to thought-stuff and making it real is addictive.</li>
            <li>Novice/tinkerer in (open) hardware</li>
            <li>Wield many O/S</li>
            <li>Text editor: <em>Vim</em></li>
            <li>IDE: <em>Visual Studio 2015</em></li>
            <li>Bit of both: <em>Visual Studio Code</em></li>
            <li>Hacking something up: <em>Python</em></li>
            <li>Pay me: <em>C#</em></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>"Software Developer"</h3>
        <p>People have problems they want to solve. Sometimes, using computers makes solving that problem easier, or makes an otherwise impossible problem solvable. </p>
        <p>A Software Developer, or "programmer" takes a problem and creates a program that solves that problem.</p>
        <p>Some kinds of problems require more thinking before they can be solved, and sometimes other people can apply their skills to turn the original problem into smaller sub-problems that are more easily solved from a developer&apos;s perspective. <em>"Analysis"</em></p>
        <p>Currently, almost everything I do requres analysis.</p>
