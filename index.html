            </header>
            <p>I&apos;ve been using computers and technology for over a decade. I enjoy taking ideas and making them reality&mdash;computers
                help us do this and achieve more in less time.</p>
            <p>I have a background in Windows, Linux, and Mac technologies, and many programming languages and paradigms.</p>
            <p>Currently, I am a practicing .NET/C# developer, working in web, mobile, and back-end/integration spaces.</p>
            <p>As far as tools go, I&apos;ll use anything from Vim to Visual Studio. I find Python a good fit for exploring
                small data sets and solving simple textual problems.</p>

            </header>
            <p>In any typical day I&apos;ll work in some or all of the following areas:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Given some database (information and relationships), extend/fix/improve it. (SQL, SQLite, T-SQL.)</li>
                <li>RESTful API development. Gets you your SOLID, OO, vertical slice of pure "developer" skillset.</li>
                <li>Some <strong>mobile</strong> development, mostly data and <strong>API</strong>-related (i.e., consumption).</li>
                <li>All the modern "<strong>website</strong>" stuff, including styling: HTML/CSS/JS/languages that transpile/compile
                    to JS (e.g., TypeScript)</li>
                <li>Generic business requirements analysis&mdash;from customer conversations to scoped development estimates</li>
                <li>Reactive and proactive issue management, root cause analysis</li>
                <li>Test case automation, user story and acceptance test validation</li>
            </ul>
