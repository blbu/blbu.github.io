        <h1>Blake Burgess&apos; Github website</h1>
        <h2>This content may move soon</h2>
		<p>Github has made some odd operational choices in recent years.</p>
		<p>I am slowly migrating to other services.</p>
		<p>This ecosystem is still okay for social coding.</p>
        <h2>The five W's</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Journeyman programmer</li>
            <li>New Zealand</li>
            <li>"Software Developer"</li>
            <li>Why? Taking a chisel to thought-stuff and making it real is addictive.</li>
            <li>Novice/tinkerer in (open) hardware</li>
            <li>Wield many O/S</li>
            <li>Text editor: <em>Vim</em></li>
            <li>IDE: <em>Visual Studio 2015</em></li>
            <li>Bit of both: <em>Visual Studio Code</em></li>
            <li>Hacking something up: <em>Python</em></li>
            <li>Pay me: <em>C#</em></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>"Software Developer"</h3>
        <p>People have problems they want to solve. Sometimes, using computers makes solving that problem easier, or makes an otherwise impossible problem solvable. </p>
        <p>A Software Developer, or "programmer" takes a problem and creates a program that solves that problem.</p>
        <p>Some kinds of problems require more thinking before they can be solved, and sometimes other people can apply their skills to turn the original problem into smaller sub-problems that are more easily solved from a developer&apos;s perspective. <em>"Analysis"</em></p>
        <p>Currently, almost everything I do requres analysis.</p>
        <h3>"Kinds" of programming/"developing" I do</h3>
        <p>For lack of time, I'm just going to dump a bunch of stuff here..</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Given some database (information and relationships), extend/fix/improve it. (SQL, SQLite, T-SQL.)</li>
            <li>"RESTful" API development. Gets you your SOLID, OO, vertical slice of pure "dev".</li>
            <li>Some <strong>mobile</strong> development, mostly data and <strong>API</strong>-related (i.e., consumption).</li>
            <li>All the modern "<strong>website</strong>" stuff, minus hands-on styling: HTML/CSS/JS/languages that transpile/compile to JS</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Projects</h3>
        <p>Stuff I am doing, want to do, and never quite got around to doing. <em>Still a TODO, but here's what I found on my desktop just quickly...</em></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Open hardware/software ergonomic keyboard</li>
            <li>Python: 3D voxel world, RPG/RTS (Minecraft + Stronghold Crusader + Sims-lite + Rogue-lite) (frozen?)</li>
            <li>Unity experiment: 3D procedural spaceship "Mafia"/"Werewolf" game, inspired by Space Station 13 (frozen). 3D ship generated from images, images generated via Python scripts.</li>
            <li>Python (was PHP):text-based browser army-building game (2005-2011, missed the boat on this one)</li>
            <li>Python: top-down space-ship fight/trade/etc game. Based on python bindings to gletools down to OpenGL. Frozen.</li>
            <li>Python: Text-based terminal game engine (frozen)</li>
            <li>Grunt (name-change pending...): indexer/index searcher, written in C. (frozen)</li>
        </ul>
